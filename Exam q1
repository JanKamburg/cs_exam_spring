1)  Consider the following class:

--------------------------------------------------------
public class Technology{
   
  String name;
  
  public Technology(String name){
    this.name=name;}
    
  public void speak(){
    System.out.println("Bleep, blip.  I am a " + name);}
    
---------------------------------------------------------    

a)  Write a subclass to Technology with a class called Smartphone.
    Add an additional integer field called number.
    Include a constructor for Smartphone that takes the "name" and "number" as parameters.

public class Smartphone extends Technology{
   int number;
   
   public Smartphone(String name, int number){
      super(name);
      this.number = number;
   }
   
}
b)  Explain what POLYMORPHISM is.
   Polymorphism is when you write a method for a sub class that also exists in the super class which means that you override it. 
c)  Write a "speak" method for Smartphone that states the "name" and "number".  
      public void speek(){
         System.out.println("Bleep, blip.  I am a " + this.name + ". And my number is " + this.number);
      }
d)  What is this called when we write a subclass method which overrides a super class method?
   Overriding
